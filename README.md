# ReconciliatonTool
a simple VBA project to help with my contract position at Broadridge Financial

I made this to automate many of the manual reconciliation procedures I was tasked with doing.
Because I made this while working for Alpha Consulting as a contractor at Broadridge Financial Solutions either Alpha or Broadridge actually own the right to use this stuff.

I tried to remove any mentions to the inner workings of Broadridge (path names and the like) but even if I've missed something, I don't think the script gives away any trade secrets.
